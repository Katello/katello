As a consequence, verifying the package with the 'rpm -V' failed due to the /etc/kpartx.conf file's size, md5sum, and last modification time having been changed. This update adds flags to the device-mapper-multipath package's spec file that inform rpm that the size, md5sum and modification time of the /etc/kpartx.conf file may change, with the result that verifying the package now succeeds in this situation. (BZ#588753)\n\nThe advisory text was updated on the 27th of April, 2011 with the following two workaround descriptions:\n\n* When the /var directory was mounted on a separate file system from the root directory ('/'), the association between mpath[n] device names and device WWIDs could have been become inconsistent. As a workaround, a bindings_file configuration option now provides a consistent mapping between mpath[n] and WWID device names. Refer to the Release Notes link provided in the References section of this erratum for further details. (BZ#509095)\n\n* Multipath is unable to reconfigure a multipath device while the multipathd service is running, or add new paths to the device. A workaround for this issue is provided in the 4.9 Release Notes, which are linked to in the References section of this advisory. (BZ#487443)\n\n[The original advisory text follows]\n\nThis update provides fixes for the following bugs:\n\n* The direction path checker occasionally dropped paths due to a too short limit for the IO. The direction checker now waits asychronously for the IO with a 30 second limit per path. (BZ#500580)\n\n* When gathering path information, multipath did not wait long enough for some sysfs files to be created. This caused it to not create some devices. It will now wait up to a minute, unless it notices that the sysfs device directory has been removed, in which case it exits early. (BZ#511034)\n\n* Multipath gave incorrect path groupings for multipath devices configured to use 'group_by_node_name'. This was due to an incorrect reporting of the target node name for iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) targets. With this update multipath checks the iSCSI target name if the fc check fails. (BZ#512065)\n\n* Multipath could have occasionally consumed a large amount of memory. This was caused by improper setting of thread size. With this update, the thread size setting is adjusted and the issue no longer occurs. (BZ#516253)\n\n* Previously, kpartx could have made incorrect partitions for devices with minor numbers greater than 255. This happened due to a mistake in calculation of minor number of devices. This update fixes the calculation procedure and the issue is fixed. (BZ#528734)\n\n* Multipathd occasionally used an incorrect UID/GID/MODE setting for the devices it created, if these were defined in multipath.conf. This was due to a race between udevd and multipathd. With this update, the issue no longer occurs. (BZ#531131)\n\n* If a multipath device configured with queue_if_no_path with no working paths was created while booting, and multipathd was not running, the machine did not boot. init scripts must call multipath with the -q option that forces multipath to disable queuing on all devices. (BZ#575244)\n\nIn addition, this updated package provides the following enhancements:\n\n* The multipath.conf file contains a new option 'queue_without_daemon' with the 'yes' default setting. If set to 'no', multipathd disables queue_if_no_paths on all devices. (BZ#488921)\n\n* A default configuration for HP HSVX700 is added. (BZ#623468)\n\nAll device-mapper-multipath users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these issues and adds these enhancements.",

With this update, the ccs_tool utility now allows users to specify the port numbers on the command line, so that the connection can be established as expected.
