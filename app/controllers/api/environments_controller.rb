      # Description

      An environment is a basic organization structure that groups systems,
      products, repositories, etc.  Every system belongs to one environment
      and it's isolated inside so that it can see only content that is in its
      environment.

      ## Chains

      Environments are ordered into chains and their content (propducts,
      repositories, tempaltes, packages) can be moved to an environment only from its
      prior environment. You can have for example chain like:

          Library -> Development -> Testing -> Production

      Each change in an environment is done through a changeset in an action
      called promotion.

      ## Library

      Library is a special environment that has no ascendant: all the content
      starts in this environment. More chains can start from the library environment but
      no further branching of a chain is enabled.
