  Returns the content of a repo gpg key, used directly by yum
  We've amended REST best practices (e.g. not using the show action) as we don't want to
  authenticate, authorize etc, trying to distinquse between a yum request and normal api request
  might not always be 100% bullet proof, and its more important that yum can fetch the key.
