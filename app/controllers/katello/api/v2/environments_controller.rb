        # Description

        An environment is a basic organization structure that groups systems,
        products, repositories, etc.  Every system belongs to one environment
        and it's isolated inside so that it can see only content that is in its
        environment.

        ## Chains

        Environments are ordered into chains and their content (propducts,
        repositories, tempaltes, packages) can be moved to an environment only from its
        prior environment. You can have for example chain like:

            Library -> Development -> Testing -> Production

        Each change in an environment is done through a changeset in an action
        called promotion.

        ## Library

        Library is a special environment that has no ascendant: All the content
        starts in this environment. More chains can start from the library environment but
        no further branching of a chain is enabled.
