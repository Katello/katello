<%# I'm thinking that creating test ACS remotes is not worth it for HTTP proxies because
    we're editing 'n' remotes rather than just one. At sync time, if a remote fails to
    update, the user can look at the error in Dynflow and likely figure out that something
    is wrong with the HTTP proxy config. %>
<%= select_f(f, :http_proxy_id, ::HttpProxy.all, :id, :name, {:include_blank => true}, {:label => _("Alternate Content Source HTTP Proxy"),
    :label_help => _('Traffic for all alternate content sources associated with this smart proxy will go through the chosen HTTP proxy.')}) %>
