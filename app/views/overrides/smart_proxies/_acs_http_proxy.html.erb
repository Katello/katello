<%# I'm thinking that creating test ACS remotes is not worth it for HTTP proxies because
    we're editing 'n' remotes rather than just one. At sync time, if a remote fails to
    update, the user can look at the error in Dynflow and likely figure out that something
    is wrong with the HTTP proxy config. %>
