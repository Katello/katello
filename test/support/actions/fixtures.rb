  module Actions

    # Module for creating actions based on yaml fixtures.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    # Given action +Actions::Pulp::Consumer::ContentInstall+
    # and files +test/fixtures/actions/pulp/consumer/content_install/input.yaml+
    # and +test/fixtures/actions/pulp/consumer/content_install/success.yaml+
    # calling:
    #
    #     fixture_action(Actions::Pulp::Consumer::ContentInstall,
    #                    input: :input,
    #                    output: :success)
    #
    # will create new action with the data from those files. The
    # stubbed data can be passed directly if needed.
    #
    #      fixture_action(Actions::Pulp::Consumer::ContentInstall,
    #                    input: { some_input: 1 }',
    #                    output: { some_output: 2 })
