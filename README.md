## About


Note: David Is Not At katello cookout

[Katello](http://www.katello.org) is a systems life cycle management
plugin to [Foreman](http://www.theforeman.org). Katello allows you to manage
thousands of machines with one click. Katello can pull content
from remote repositories into isolated environments, and make subscriptions
management a breeze.

Currently, it is able to handle Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux based systems.

## Development

The recommended way to set up Katello for development to use the [katello-devel-installer](https://github.com/Katello/katello-installer#development-usage) directly or via [katello-deploy](https://github.com/Katello/katello-deploy#development-deployment).

### Test Run

At this point, the development environment should be completely setup and the Katello engine functionality available. To verify this, go to your Foreman checkout:

1. Start the development server

    ```bash
    cd $GITDIR/foreman

    rails s
    ```

2. Access Foreman in your browser (e.g. `http://<hostname>:3000/`)
3. Login to Foreman (default: `admin` and `changeme`)
4. Create an initial Foreman organization
5. Navigate to the Katello engine (e.g. `http://<hostname>:3000/katello`)

### Start the background jobs processor

You also will need the delayed_jobs engine to be running to process Katello's async tasks.  To start it do:

    ```bash
    cd $GITDIR/foreman

    rake jobs:work
    ```

### Reset Development Environment

In order to reset the development environment, all backend data and the database needs to be reset. To reiterate, the following will destroy all data in Pulp, Candlepin and your Foreman/Katello database. From the Foreman checkout run:

```bash
rake katello:reset
```
