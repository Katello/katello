## About

[Katello](https://www.theforeman.org/plugins/katello/) is a systems life cycle management
plugin to [Foreman](https://www.theforeman.org). Katello allows you to manage
thousands of machines with one click. Katello can pull content
from remote repositories into isolated environments, and make subscriptions
management a breeze.

Currently, it is able to handle Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux based systems.

## Development

The most common way to set up Katello for development is to use
[katello-deploy](https://github.com/Katello/katello-deploy#development-deployment).
This will set up a Vagrant instance with the Katello codebase checked out. You
can also run `setup.rb` directly with katello-deploy if you prefer to not use
Vagrant.

There is also
[katello-devel-installer](https://github.com/Katello/katello-installer#development-usage)
if you would like to use that.

If you have questions or issues with any of the above methods, feel free to ask
for assistance on #theforeman-dev IRC channel or via the foreman-dev mailing
list.

### Test Run

At this point, the development environment should be completely setup and the Katello engine functionality available. To verify this, go to your Foreman checkout:

1. Start the development server

    ```bash
    cd $GITDIR/foreman

    rails s
    ```

1. Access Foreman in your browser (e.g. `https://<hostname>/`). Note that while Rails will listen on port 3000, the dev installer will set up a reverse proxy so HTTPS on port 443 will work.
1. Login to Foreman (default: `admin` and `changeme`)
1. If you go to `https://<hostname>/about` and view the "Plugins" tab, you should see a "Katello" plugin listed.

### Reset Development Environment

In order to reset the development environment, all backend data and the database needs to be reset. To reiterate, *the following will destroy all data in Pulp, Candlepin and your Foreman/Katello database*. From the Foreman checkout run:

```bash
rake katello:reset
```
