- + both new user and modifying a user's environment now work + TODO: probably
  need to wordsmith form labels
- user#create updated for optional default env

  choice box allows none (controller not updated yet)

- Not allowing a superadmin to create a user if the org does not ahave any
  environments from which to choose
- Now older subscription managers can register against Katello without
  providing an org or environment

  not the org you created will be destroyed and you will be given proper error
  messages. I added a feature to pass a prepend string to the error in case
  there are two items you are trying to create on the page. It would have been
  easier to just prepend it at the time of message creation, but that would
  have affected every page. Perhaps we can revisit this in the future

  column headers.  Switches from standard column rendering to use custom column
  rendering function via custom_columns in the systems helper module.
- Adds new option to the two panel display, :custom_columns, whereby a function
  name can be passed that will do the work of rendering the columns in the left
  side of the panel.  This is for cases when column data needs custom
  manipulation or data rows need a customized look and feel past the standard
  table look and feel.
