Contributing to Katello
=======================

As an open-source project, we enjoy working with the community. We've developed
some guidelines though for contributing to Katello. Please see our
[development guidelines](http://www.katello.org/developers/).
Also, make sure your code conforms to our style guidelines:

* [Ruby guidelines](http://www.katello.org/developers/style/ruby.html)
* [Javascript guidelines](http://www.katello.org/developers/style/javascript.html)

Be sure to check out our README and let us know on our mailing list or IRC
if you have any questions.
