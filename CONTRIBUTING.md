Contributing to Katello
=======================

As an open-source project, we enjoy working with the community. We've developed
some guidelines though for contributing to Katello. Please see our
[development guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/DevProcess).
Also, make sure your code conforms to our style guidelines:

* [Ruby guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/RubyCodeConventions)
* [Javascript guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/JavascriptCodeConventions)
* [Python guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/PythonCodeConventions)

Be sure to check out our README and let us know on our mailing list or IRC
if you have any questions.
