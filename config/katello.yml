# Common configuration
#
# The following configuration values are the same for production, test
# and development environments. Values can be overriden bellow.
#
# host (default=127.0.0.1): The host (i.e. fully qualified domain name) of the
#   server.  This host is used by ActionMailer when generating urls sent in
#   emails from the server.  For example, the host would be the fqdn portion
#   of a URL for resetting a user's password.
#
# port: Similar to host; however, provides the port component of the URL.
#
# password_reset_expiration (default=120): Specifies the number of
#   minutes that a password reset token will remain valid.
