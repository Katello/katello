This directory contains upgrade scripts. Before writing your first script,
please read katello-upgrade man page and read this file.

Header
------

Each script must have executable flag, shebang and header in the following
format:

  #name: Short name starting with capital
  #apply: katello headpin
  #run: always
  #description:
  #Multiline description of the step. Please write several sentences
  #here as users will be presented this before confirming this step.

Apply field must have space separated list of modes in which this script
applies. Possible values are: "katello" and "headpin".

Run field can be only set to "always" or "once".

ALL FIELDS ARE REQUIRED!

Script content
--------------

Scripts can be written in Bash, Python or Ruby. Make sure Python scripts
are not creating pyc/pyo files, use the following shebang:

  #!/usr/bin/python -B

Script MUST return zero value when everything is fine, non-zero value
otherwise.

Both stdout and stderr are redirected to the log file (and stdout in
verbose mode). It is recommended to print several messages, but keep the
output not too much verbose

Multiple use
------------

ALL scripts MUST be invariant. That means user MUST be able to execute it
multiple times without breaking things.

Type of scripts
---------------

Always - script is executed every katello-upgrade run, it can be skipped
in the interactive mode, but it is executed by default.

Once - script is executed only once, then is "marked" as done and never
executed again.

Testing
-------

Always test your upgrade scripts on all supported platforms.
