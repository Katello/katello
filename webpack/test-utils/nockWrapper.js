// Using the library 'nock' as it matches actual network requests rather than mock another
// library. This is helpful when the request is not coming from Katello. For example, axios
// called within Katello can be mocked with axios-mock-adapter or similar, but a http request
// made by axios that is coming from Foreman cannot be mocked by axios-mock-adapter or a
// jest mock within Katello. So to do this, we can mock the request a level deeper within
// nodejs by using nock.

// Calling .done() with nock asserts that the request was fufilled. We use a timeout to ensure
// that the component has set up and made the request before the assertion is made. This function
// polls until the nock scope is met. If the `done` callback from jest is passed in, it will
// call it once the request is made, telling jest the test is done. This is to make sure all
// nock expectations are met and cleared before moving on to the next test.
// Test checks every `interval` milliseconds if the nock scope was met.
// The number of tries dictates the number of attempts assert will make before failing.
// `tries * interval` is the maximum time that every nock scope will wait before failing if not met.
