KATELLO ISO DELIVERY
====================
This ISO contains the packages for the katello project. Users will need
to follow a two step process for the installation.

Step 1 is to run install_packages from this ISO. It will create a
temporary yum repo file on your machine, and will install the packages
for you. This script will also handle updates to an already installed
machine.

Step 2 is to run katello_configure as documented in the installation
guide. This will configure the machine so that it is ready to run.
